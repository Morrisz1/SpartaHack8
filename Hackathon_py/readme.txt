In this file there are 3 csv files that all contain data collected from a Dexcom G6 gluocouse monitor. This app was designed to help easily access the data on linux and older devices because
the Dexcom app they supply does not have any linux version and with the streamlit version it could also be uploaded to a website and allow for easier access to information that way. I recommend
using the main.py first and following the prompts entering the old data as BG_3_Months.csv and new data as BG_14_Days.csv with the target parameters being 110
